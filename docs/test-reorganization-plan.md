# Test Reorganization Plan — collab::model

> This isn't just a migration. The old test structure was organized per-path (typed, hybrid, dynamic, type_instance), which made coverage gaps invisible. The new structure organizes tests by **capability**, with typed/hybrid/dynamic interleaved so gaps are structurally impossible to ignore.

## Problem

Four test files, each covering one type_def path:

| File | Tests | Path |
|---|---|---|
| test_type_def.cpp | 76 | typed |
| test_hybrid_type_def.cpp | 36 | hybrid |
| test_dynamic_type_def.cpp | 31 | dynamic |
| test_type_instance.cpp | 22 | dynamic (instances) |

This structure hides coverage gaps. An agent adding a test to `test_type_def.cpp` never sees `test_hybrid_type_def.cpp`, so they never think "does hybrid need this too?" Result: hybrid has zero type-level meta tests, `has_field()` coverage is 6/1/1 across paths, edge cases only tested on typed.

## Solution

Capability-oriented files where typed/hybrid/dynamic tests for the **same behavior** sit within a few lines of each other:

```cpp
// ═══ has_field() — finds fields by name ═══
TEST_CASE("typed: has_field() finds field<> members", ...)
TEST_CASE("hybrid: has_field() finds registered members", ...)
TEST_CASE("dynamic: has_field() finds builder fields", ...)

// ═══ has_field() — rejects unknown names ═══
TEST_CASE("typed: has_field() rejects unknown names", ...)
TEST_CASE("hybrid: has_field() rejects unknown names", ...)
TEST_CASE("dynamic: has_field() rejects unknown names", ...)
```

If you're adding a typed test, the hybrid and dynamic versions are three lines below. You'd have to actively look away to not add them too.

## New file structure

### Shared header

**`test_model_types.hpp`** — all test structs, metadata types, and `reflect_on` specializations in one place. Currently these are duplicated with `_d`, `_h`, `_o` suffixes across the 4 old files. The shared header eliminates all duplication.

Contents:
- Metadata types: `endpoint_info`, `help_info`, `tag_info`, `cli_meta`, `render_meta`
- Typed structs (with `field<>` / `meta<>`): `SimpleArgs`, `Dog`, `MixedStruct`, `MultiTagged`, `MetaOnly`, `SingleField`, `CliArgs`
- Hybrid structs (plain C++): `PlainDog`, `PlainPoint`
- Hybrid structs (with `meta<>`): `MetaDog`
- `reflect_on<T>()` specializations for all of the above (inside `#ifndef COLLAB_FIELD_HAS_PFR`)

### Capability files (9 total)

Each file follows the same pattern:
1. `#include` the shared header + catch2
2. `import collab.core;`
3. Sections grouped by **sub-capability**, with typed/hybrid/dynamic interleaved within each section

## Files NOT being migrated

These stay as-is:
- **test_field.cpp** — tests the `field<T>` wrapper type itself (default construction, conversion, operator->, with<> extensions, is_field concept, reflected_struct concept)
- **test_meta.cpp** — tests the `meta<T>` wrapper type itself (construction, value access, operator->, is_meta concept, aggregate usage)
- **test_type_schema.cpp** — tests the `type_definition` concept and generic functions constrained by it

## Migration process

1. Create `test_model_types.hpp` with all shared types
2. Create each capability file one at a time, building and running after each
3. Old and new files coexist — test count only goes up
4. Track progress in `docs/test-migration-checklist.md` — subagent verification only
5. When checklist is 100% checked, delete old files one at a time, verifying test count drops by exactly the right amount
6. Delete checklist and this plan doc
7. Add CLAUDE.md rule: agents must maintain coverage for all features across typed/hybrid/dynamic — no capability tested on one path may be left untested on another applicable path

## Gap fills (💀 NEW tests to write during migration)

These are tests that don't exist today but should. They'll be written as new tests in the capability files:

- Hybrid: has_meta(), meta(), meta_count(), metas() (zero coverage today)
- Hybrid: has_field() for meta names, plain members, edge cases (1 test today vs typed's 6)
- Dynamic: stateless (two type_def instances equivalent)
- Dynamic/hybrid: single-field edge cases
- Hybrid: set() overwrites existing values
- Hybrid: get() callback (non-throw happy path)
- Hybrid/dynamic: get<V>() on const instance
- Typed/hybrid: multiple instances are independent
